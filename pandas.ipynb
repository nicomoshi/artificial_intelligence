Introduction\n","In this notebook, we'll build on the skills we learned last week in our introduction to numpy module, and work towards manipulating more sophisticated datasets in Pandas. To work effectively with pandas you will need to be familiar with loading data, presenting summary statistics and descriptions of the data, cleaning the data, and accessing subsets using slicing syntax. Some of these skills, such as the slicing syntax, you will be somewhat familiar with. Others, such as loading and cleaning the data, are likely new for you, but are thankfully straightforward using pandas' inbuilt routines.\n","\n","In this notebook, we'll go over these basics, and do some introductory data manipulation on a dummy dataset. These skills will combine with what you have learned about ipython notebooks, numpy and pyplot (which you'll learn next week) to form the basis of your machine learning toolkit. Once we're comfortable with these basics, we'll be able to move onto more interesting tasks such as regression and classification.\n","\n","\n","## 2.
